1. Problem
Sales professionals often struggle to prepare effectively for meetings, navigate live conversations confidently, and craft tailored follow‑ups. Key challenges include:
- Limited visibility into customer background (company size, history, prior interactions) before meetings.
- Difficulty accessing real‑time product or solution information verbally during discussions, reducing customer confidence.
- Inconsistent proposal quality and time‑consuming customisation.
- Gaps in historical account context, leading to missed opportunities or repeated questions.
- Language, dialect, and voice communication barriers that hinder natural, effective conversations across regions.
2. Solution
An AI‑powered, voice‑enabled sales enablement suite integrated with CRM (e.g., Dynamics 365) and internal systems, designed to support sales reps before, during, and after customer engagements:

Feature 1: Pre‑Meeting Intelligence Agent
- Pulls company data (size, locations, industry, recent news) from internal/external sources (CRM, LinkedIn, corporate websites).
- Summarises customer history, prior interactions, and potential objections.
- Generates talking points and personalised pitch angles.

Feature 2: Real‑Time Voice‑Enabled Meeting Assistant Agent
- Voice recognition actively listens in meetings and provides live, discreet prompts.
- Offers spoken or on‑screen suggestions for probing questions and objection handling.
- Provides real‑time product/solution FAQs (Ricoh OS, MFPs, PPs) and relevant case studies.
- Supports multilingual speech‑to‑text and translation, adapting tone and phrasing for local cultures.

Feature 3: Proposal Builder Agent
- Auto‑generates draft proposals with relevant case studies, ROI data, and tailored content.
- Allows quick editing and finalisation by the salesperson.

Feature 4: Context Tracker Agent
- Surfaces past interactions, key stakeholders, and previous issues.
- Provides contract renewal reminders and relevant historical insights.
